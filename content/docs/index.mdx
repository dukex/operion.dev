## Core Concepts

### Triggers
Triggers are the entry points for your workflows. Operion supports various trigger types:

- [Kafka Trigger](/docs/triggers/kafka-trigger) - React to Kafka messages
- [Queue Trigger](/docs/triggers/queue-trigger) - Process messages from queues
- [Custom Triggers](/docs/triggers/trigger-service) - Build your own trigger types

### Workflows
Workflows define the business logic and processing steps for your automation. Use the [Visual Editor](/docs/visual-editor) to design workflows or write them in code.
